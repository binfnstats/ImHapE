This repository contains code for image-based haplotype-guided evolutionary inferences for populations with phased genomes. IHapE treats evolutionary inference as an image recognition problem, harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks. Images are formed by aligning haplotypes, or entire genomes together, to make evolutionary inferences.
