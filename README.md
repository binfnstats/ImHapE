This repository contains code for *image-based haplotype-guided evolutionary inferences* for populations with phased genomes. **IHapE** treats evolutionary inference as an image recognition problem, harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks. Images are formed by aligning haplotypes, or entire genomes together, to make evolutionary inferences.
